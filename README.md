# Misc - Snippets, write-ups, PoCs, etc.
I realized that people probably don't look through my gists for interesting content any more often than I look through theirs, so I've moved a few interesting ones here. I guess this is the sort of thing I would put on a blog if I had one.

## Highlights
[GatherJS](JS/gatherJS) is a concise example of how to refactor ES2015 code to a point-free, functional style using Ramda.

There have been several occasions where I've illustrated some algorithms (and how to access object internals in Python) for friends:

- How [explore a continuous region](gridDFS/) in a 2D grid using depth-first search, with animated output. Fragile GIF support.
- A [template class](deBruijn/) for algorithms on De Bruijn graphs.
- How to [structure a class](game_data_in_python/) for a simple text-based RPG in Python

Python snippets:

- [Avoid blocking on a possibly infinite pipe from STDIN](PyPipes/)
- Use PyInotify to [automatically run your test suite](PyAutotest/) whenever you update certain project files.

There are a few \*NIX-y things here as well:

- [Parsing SSH logs](ssh_scripts/sshlogs/)
- [Configuring a Digital Ocean VPS for SSH access](ssh_scripts/sshconfig/)
- How to [build OpenMP in 2016](buildOpenMP/) on Ubuntu 14.04. I had a hard time finding current and concise documentation on this.
